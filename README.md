## Supervised ML to predict the score.

This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for The Sparks Foundation.
   * Internship Category - Computer vision
   * Internship Duration - 1 Month ( February-2021 )
   * Internship Type - Work from Home
   
## Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML
To predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
I have used Python programming language to implement this.

According to my prediction I got the result as :- 
### Q. What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/ day?
### A. 96.01612
